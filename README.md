# Algorithms
🧠 A list of sample algorithms every programmer should know and understand

📖 Thanks for looking through these algorithms! Should you find any problems in 
explanations or code, don't be afraid to make a new issue!

🐍 All algorithms are written in Python, but they are explained, so translation to
another language shouldnt be too hard.
